S3N is a decentralised identity and verifiable credential protocol that aims to unlock real-world value for the decentralised web through zero-knowledge, enabling solvency and data aggregation, and attestation.

It aims to provide a system whereby users have complete self-sovereignty over their identity and credential data. Our mission at ZERO Labs is to enable issuance of data without the need to explicitly onboard any Issuers. And with [S3N Core](/s3n-core) we can notarise and commit to credentials in a permissionless manner, hence opening the door to solvency proof, aggregated internet data, powering everything comprising a userâ€™s data on the open web.
