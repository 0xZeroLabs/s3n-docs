S3N is a decentralised self-sovereign identity solution that enables permissionless issuance, verifiable provenance, and trustless verification of credentials.

It integrates a trusted notaries AVS called [Core](/s3n-core), on EigenLayer as a secure replacement for signing credentials, thereby enabling an open ecosystem for secure identity without the explicit need for issuer permission.

Identity and credential data are made interoperable by using the W3C veriable credentials standard and can be verified and used in applications through selective disclosure via non-interactive succinct zero-knowledge proofs. This process is called zero-knowledge data [Migration](/build-on-s3n/zk-migration/).
